# Genomic Selection for Drought Tolerance

Welcome to the Genomic Selection for Drought Tolerance project website! This initiative by EMBRAPA Mandioca focuses on utilizing Genome Wide GBS and/or DART in Cassava to achieve drought tolerance through genomic selection.

## About the Project
This project details the estimation of Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs) using mixed models, along with extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and necessary manipulations to accurately estimate the BLUPs.

### Genomic Wide Selection (GWS)

For GWS, we employed the original marker matrix, followed by necessary data manipulations to organize and prepare the matrix for model input. We used various models, including:

- **RR-BLUP**
- **G-BLUP (additive and additive-dominant)**
- **Bayes A**
- **Bayes B**
- **RKHS**
- **Random Forest**

(Note: Some models might be computationally intensive.)
